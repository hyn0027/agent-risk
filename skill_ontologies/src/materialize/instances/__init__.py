"""Concrete instances behind the model's kinds, and effects resolved to them.

    model.py      Instance, Instances, Target
    registry.py   @environment sources and the Context they get (how to add one)
    envs/         one module per environment: nanoclaw, credentials, github, vercel
    resolve.py    effect on a kind -> targets (instances, new instances, hosts)

``discover`` runs every applicable source once per run and types the instances into
the snapshot graph; ``resolve``/``targets`` are used by the tables, the downstream
walk, and the joint-risk annotation.
